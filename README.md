Picklelo is a platform that automatically tracks the ELO rating of registered users relative to each other, based on the recorded pickleball matches on the platform.

The UI is currently hosted at https://nahcnayrb.github.io/Picklelo

No account is necessary to look at the current player stats, but an account is needed to modify existing matches! :)
